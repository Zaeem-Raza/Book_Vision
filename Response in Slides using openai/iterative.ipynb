The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, F = ma.  SI unit of force is newton (N).

He further concluded that there exists a force due to which everybody of the universe attracts every other body. He named this force the force of gravitation.

Before we discuss these laws, it is appropriate to understand various terms such as force, inertia and momentum.

According to this law, action is always accompanied by a reaction force and the two forces must always be equal and opposite. Note that action and reaction forces act on different bodies.
