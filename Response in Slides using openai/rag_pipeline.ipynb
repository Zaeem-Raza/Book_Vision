    "This notebook demonstrates a pipeline for automatically generating LaTeX Beamer presentations based on a user's query. The process involves extracting relevant content from a PDF, embedding the text chunks, retrieving the most relevant sections using a search model, and generating LaTeX code with OpenAI's GPT model.

    "### Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cell, we import all the required libraries for the task. The libraries include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `openai`: Used to interact with OpenAI's API to generate responses for LaTeX Beamer code based on the provided query.\n",
    "- `my_secrets`: A custom module where sensitive information, like API keys, is stored securely.\n",
    "- `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as creating directories and running system commands.\n",
    "- `subprocess`: Used to run external system commands, in this case, to compile LaTeX code into a PDF.\n",
    "- `sentence_transformers`: A library for generating sentence embeddings (numerical representations) of text, which is used for comparing and retrieving chunks of text.\n",
    "- `faiss`: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, which helps in finding the most relevant chunks of text based on a query.\n",
    "- `numpy`: A library used for handling arrays, which is essential for working with the embeddings.\n",
    "- `chunks`: A custom module that presumably contains the `MyChunks` class or object that holds the chunked text from the PDF.\n",

    "### Initializing Sentence Embeddings, FAISS Index, and Setting Up Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cell, we perform several key initializations for embedding and indexing text chunks from a PDF document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Sentence Transformer Model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use the `SentenceTransformer` model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to generate sentence embeddings. This model is pre-trained to create dense vector representations (embeddings) of text, which can be used for tasks like similarity search and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Embedding Dimension**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `dimension` is set to 384, which corresponds to the number of features in the embeddings generated by the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. This is the fixed size of the vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating FAISS Index**:\n",
    "   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to efficiently search through the embeddings. We initialize a `IndexFlatL2` index, which will store the embeddings in a way that allows us to quickly compute similarity searches (in this case, using L2 distance).\n",
    "4. **Setting Up Embedding Storage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - An empty list `embeddings` is created to store the embeddings generated for each chunk of text. This list will be used later to hold the embeddings of the text chunks from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating Directory for Extracted Images**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We define a directory called `extracted_images` to store any images that might be extracted from the PDF. The `os.makedirs` function ensures that this directory is created if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Initializing Chunks**:\n",
    "   - The `MyChunks` object is assumed to be a collection of text chunks from the PDF, which will be used later to generate embeddings and perform similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is essential for embedding the text chunks from the PDF, storing them in an index, and making them ready for querying based on the user's input.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this cell, the function `embed_and_index_chunks()` is responsible for embedding the text chunks from the PDF and indexing them for efficient retrieval. Here's a breakdown of what this function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check if Chunks Are Already Embedded**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The function first checks if the `embeddings` list is already populated. If the embeddings are already computed, the function prints `\"Chunks already embedded and indexed.\"` and exits early, avoiding redundant work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Text from Chunks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the embeddings are not yet created, the function loops through each chunk in the `MyChunks` collection.\n",
    "   - For each chunk, it extracts the `text` field and passes it to the `embedding_model.encode()` method, which generates an embedding (a vector representation) of the text. This embedding is then appended to the `embeddings` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing the Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Each embedding is added to the FAISS index using the `index.add()` method. Since FAISS requires the embeddings to be in the form of `float32` arrays, the code converts the embedding to the appropriate format using `np.array([embedding]).astype(\"float32\")`.\n",
    "\n",
