Force is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the interaction between objects or bodies, causing a change in their motion. According to Newton's second law of motion, when a net force acts on a body, it produces acceleration in the body in the direction of the net force. The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, force (F) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a), represented as F = ma. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as the force required to produce an acceleration of 1 m/s² in a body with a mass of 1 kg. Force can move or tend to move, stop or tend to stop the motion of a body, change the direction of motion, and even change the shape or size of a body on which it acts. Additionally, every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force, as per Newton's third law of motion.
