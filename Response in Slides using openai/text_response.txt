Force is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the interaction between objects, causing a change in their motion. According to Newton's second law of motion, when a net force acts on an object, it produces acceleration in the object in the direction of the net force. The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. Mathematically, force (F) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a), represented as F = ma. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as the force required to produce an acceleration of 1 m/s^2 in a body of mass 1 kg. Forces can move, stop, or change the direction of motion of an object, and they can also change the shape or size of the object they act upon. Additionally, forces can be classified as action-reaction pairs, following Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
